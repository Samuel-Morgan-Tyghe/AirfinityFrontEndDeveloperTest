If data was not in alphabetical order, I would create a comparison if statement, then pushes accordingly.

I have limited data for UX, but there need to be page numbers or a better way to navigate info. 
page numbers, or expand buttons. 

add some CSS that doesn't look 20 years old.
3d tables look interesting

I used react-table, looks like Chakra uses it, so I think its more compatible with company standards
react table is good at implementing quickly but not the best for customisation


The logic works for displaying county and state names, but it would be better to display them in different columns as not to be confused
displays data of the previous day, more logic would be needed to accept multiple days 


I predict complications, if the data from API changes i would need to alter the code
